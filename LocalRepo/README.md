# Assignment-1

Count Frequency of Characters in a String (Ignore Case)
Return a dictionary with character frequencies.

### Custom String Compression
Compress a string using counts of repeated characters.

def compress_string(s):
    pass
Example: "aaabbccccd" → "a3b2c4d1"

​
#### Move Zeroes to End
Move all 0's to the end of a list without changing the order of other elements.

def move_zeroes(nums):
    pass

Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

​
### DICTIONARY-Based Coding Questions
Character Frequency in a String
Return a dictionary of character counts (case insensitive).

def char_frequency(s):
    pass


​
### Find Key with Maximum Value
Given a dictionary, return the key with the highest value.

def max_value_key(d):
    pass


​
### Group Elements by Frequency
Given a list, return a dictionary with frequency of each element.

def frequency_dict(lst):
    pass


​
### Invert a Dictionary
Swap keys and values in a dictionary. If duplicate values exist, store keys in a list.

def invert_dict(d):
    pass


​
### Merge Two Dictionaries with Sum of Values
If keys overlap, their values should be added.

def merge_dicts_sum(d1, d2):
    pass

Input: d1 = {"a": 10, "b": 5}, d2 = {"a": 3, "c": 8}
Output: {"a": 13, "b": 5, "c": 8}


​
## Binary Search 
Implement binary search using recursion.

def binary_search(arr, target, low, high):
    pass

​
### Generate All Subsets (Power Set)
Use recursion to generate all subsets of a given list.

def power_set(nums):
    pass

Input: [1, 2] → Output: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
